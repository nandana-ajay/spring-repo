[Spring Boot in Practice](https://www.manning.com/books/spring-boot-in-practice?utm_source=musib&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=book_musib_spring_3_16_21&a_aid=musib&a_bid=27d46a98) is a Spring Boot book written by [Somnath Musib](https://musibs.github.io) and published by Manning Publications. It's currently available through the Manning Early Access Program (MEAP). This book covers dozens of handy Spring Boot development techniques, from basic functions to hidden features you probably didn’t even know existed. Each recipe is built around a real-world problem and shows you how Spring Boot can provide a simple and elegant solution.

This repository contains the source code accompanying the book.

## Gradle and Maven

The code samples in the book use Apache Maven as the build tool. If you prefer Gradle over Maven, here's a table mapping Maven commands to Gradle:

| Maven                            | Gradle                     |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `./mvnw clean`                   | `./gradlew clean`          |
| `./mvnw install`                 | `./gradlew build`          |
| `./mvnw test`                    | `./gradlew test`           |
| `./mvnw repackage`               | `./gradlew bootJar`        |
| `./mvnw spring-boot:run`         | `./gradlew bootRun`        |
| `./mvnw spring-boot:build-image` | `./gradlew bootBuildImage` |
